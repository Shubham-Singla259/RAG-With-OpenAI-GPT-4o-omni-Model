# RAG with OpenAI GPT-4o Model Using Objectbox Vector Database

## Overview
This project integrates the powerful language generation capabilities of the OpenAI GPT-4o model with the efficient data retrieval features of the Objectbox Vector Database. The system uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to first retrieve relevant information from the Objectbox Vector Database and then generate comprehensive, contextually accurate responses with the GPT-4o model.

## ✨ Features
- Efficiently retrieves relevant data vectors from Objectbox.
- Generates accurate and context-aware responses using OpenAI GPT-4o.
- Supports large-scale data storage and retrieval.
- Provides easy integration into various applications.
- Combines retrieval and generation for improved performance.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load data vectors into the Objectbox Vector Database.
2. **Query Input**: Input a query into the system.
3. **Data Retrieval**: The system retrieves relevant data vectors from the Objectbox database.
4. **Response Generation**: GPT-4o processes the retrieved information and generates a detailed response.
5. **Result Output**: The generated response is returned to the user.

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset for training and testing the system can be any relevant text-based dataset. Here's an example of how to prepare your dataset:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather relevant text data for your application.
2. **Format Data**: Ensure the data is in a format suitable for the Objectbox Vector Database.
3. **Ingest Data**: Load the formatted data into the Objectbox database.

## ⚙️ Model Training

You can train the GPT-4o model using any relevant training framework. Here's an example of how to use the OpenAI API for model training:

```python
import openai

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Generate a response
def generate_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine='gpt-4o',
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```
